# Wachyadoin
Every 30 minutes, a dialog box asks you "whachyadoin" and records that in daily log files in ~/NOTES/LOG/.


## Usage
To use wachyadoin, simply invoke it from the command line and run in background

```
$ chmod +x wachyadoin
$ ./wachyadoin &
```

## Background
I find it useful to log in your activities. At the end of the day,week,month, you can easily see where you put your efforts, where you wasted time, what was that URL again ? oh, if only I have saved it somewhere...

If you wait till the end of your workday to record your thoughts, you may not remember all the details. This is where wachyadoin comes in handy in that, while you're at the task, it will act as a reminder to log anything that might be worth to remember.

So simple, yet so useful.
